FaultPoint.com is (mostly) an assortment of vulnerability research and exploit development focused technical blog posts, maintained by elbee. The purpose of this site is to maintain independent research for different corners of RE/VR as I (and some others) explore them.

Unfinished projects that will recieve posts:
- Unspecified Mobile Fuzzing Project
-- Custom snapshot-based fuzzer for a mobile component
- A guide on characterizing external devboards for power analysis
-- Hopefully a helpful guide on modification of external targets for SCA
- A guide on performing SCA with the Chipwhisperer Lite
-- Including syncing clock signals, hooking up the twenty pin, and how to insert a shunt or measure radiation.
- EMFI
-- A simple guide to electromagnetic fault injection
