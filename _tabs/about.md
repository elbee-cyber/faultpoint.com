FaultPoint.com is (mostly) an assortment of vulnerability research and exploit development focused technical blog posts, maintained by elbee. The purpose of this site is to maintain independent research for different corners of RE/VR as I (and some others) explore them.

Unfinished projects that will recieve posts:
- Kernel Exploitation
-- Write-up on a kernel slub challenge I wrote
- Unspecified Mobile Fuzzing Project
-- Custom fuzzer for a *currently* undisclosed mobile component
- A guide on characterizing external devboards for power analysis
-- Hopefully a helpful guide on modification of external targets for SCA
- EMFI
-- A simple guide to electromagnetic fault injection
